## Quantitative Analysis with Pandas Application

Build a quantitative analyst for a FinTech investing platform. This platform aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios thatâ€™s both inexpensive and high quality.  To keep the costs low, the firm uses algorithms to build each client's portfolio. The algorithms choose from various investment styles and options.

Evaluate four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios. Determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

## User stories:
- Analyze the Performance
Analyze the data to determine if any of the portfolios outperform the broader stock market, which the S&P 500 represents. To do so, complete the following steps:

- Analyze the Volatility
Analyze the volatility of each of the four fund portfolios and of the S&P 500 Index by using box plots.

- Analyze the Risk
Evaluate the risk profile of each portfolio by using the standard deviation and the beta

- Analyze the Risk-Return Profile
Calculate the Sharpe ratios for each portfolio to determine the risk-retrun profile.
